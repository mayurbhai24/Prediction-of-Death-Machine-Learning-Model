# Prediction-of-Death-Machine-Learning-Model
Machine learning model to analyze the relationship between individuals who have survived and died due to heart failure and serum sodium levels in blood.

Data contains several factors that can predict death due to heart failure such as CPK enzyme, ejection fraction, age, and sex of patients. The model is used to find the relation between high serum sodium levels and mortality. An unequal one-way ANOVA table was used to analyze the correlation.
